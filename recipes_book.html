            <li>Scoop a big spoonful of thick coconut cream from the top of the coconut milk can. Add it to a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir in the garlic, onions, chile, and salt. Saut√© for a couple minutes, just long enough for everything to soften up.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining coconut milk, and the water, and bring to a simmer before adding the broccoli and spinach. Simmer just long enough for the broccoli to get tender throughout, 2 - 4 minutes.

            <li>Immediately remove the soup from heat and puree with an immersion blender. Add more water if you feel the need to thin the soup out. Taste and add more salt if needed.</li>

        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt as you would pasta water. Boil the broccoli just long enough to take the raw edge of - 10 or 15 seconds. Drain and immerse it in cold water (or let cold water run over it). At this point, I like to spin the broccoli in a salad spinner to get the water off, but a few good knocks against the sink in a strainer can do the trick pretty well. Set aside.
</li>
                <li>Make the dressing by sprinkling the salt over the clove of garlic. Smash the clove and chop, smash and chop - turning it into a paste. In a small bowl whisk the salty garlic paste with the almond butter, lemon juice, honey and olive oil. Add the hot water and whisk until light and creamy. Taste, make any adjustments, and set aside.
</li>
                <li>In a large bowl gently toss the broccoli, apples, red onion, most of the shallots and nuts with a generous drizzle of the almond dressing. Turn out onto a platter and finish with the rest of the shallots and chives if you like. Serve family style.

        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the rice:
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add the rice to the boiling water, reduce the heat to a simmer, partially cover, and cook until the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Drain off the remaining water and return the rice to the pot. Cover tightly and let the rice sit for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.

</li>
                <li>Make the sauce:

In a bowl or jar whisk together the tahini, miso, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, soy sauce, syrup. Whisk in warm water 2 tablespoons at a time until the dressing is thick but able to be drizzled. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Cook the tofu:
Heat a splash of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the tofu in a single layer until the bottoms are golden. I tend to cook just one side. Remove from the pan, transfer to a plate, and season with salt and a generous sprinkling of five spice. Set aside.
/li>
                <li>Steam the vegetables:

In a large pot fitted with a steamer basket or insert, bring 1-inch of water to a boil. Arrange the vegetables in the basket. Cover and steam until the vegetables are tender but with some bite remaining, this typically takes just a few minutes. If you are using thinner or smaller vegetables, add them to the steamer a couple minutes after the more substantial vegetables go in.</li>
                <li>Assemble the macro bowls:
Divide the rice among serving bowls. Top each bowl with vegetables, tofu, and a generous drizzle of the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, and add a bit of kimchi (or other fermented vegetables). Enjoy warm.
