        <p>Hi All,<br>Welcome back to blog, Hope youâ€™re well & fine.<br>
Letâ€™s dive into blogðŸŽ¯</p></div>
    <img class="pic"  src="https://setmycareer.com/resources/images/web-developer-header.webp" alt="how to be come a web developer">
   <div class="info"> <p>When I moved to the United Kingdom, I wanted to find a way to work and study remotely from home. I knew I needed a career that offered flexibility, creativity, and growthâ€”and thatâ€™s when I discovered web development.

</h2>
        <h6>April 2025</h6>
        
        <p>With no previous background in tech, I started teaching myself online. I searched for websites, tutorials, and online communities that support beginners learning how to code. Thatâ€™s when I came across a life-changing community: Code Your Future.<br><br>
        
        
Code Your Future is a non-profit organization that supports people from underserved backgrounds to become professional developers. Their free program and step-by-step learning path helped me build a solid foundation.</p>
       
       <h2 id="learning-html">Learning HTML & CSS
</h2> 
        <p>As part of their curriculum, I began studying HTML and CSSâ€”the fundamental building blocks of the web. I learned how to:
</p>
       <ul>
           <ol>
               <li>Structure webpages with HTML elements and semantic tags</li>
               <li>Style pages using CSS, including layout techniques like Flexbox

</li>
           </ol>
       </ul>
       
        <h2 id="hands-on-project">Hands-On Projects with Khan Academy
</h2> 
        <p>To put my skills into practice, I was assigned four projects from Khan Academyâ€™s Computer Programming course. These projects challenged me to apply what I had learned and start building real webpages from scratch.<br>
Each project gave me a deeper understanding of how HTML and CSS work together, and how important clean code and design thinking are in web development.
</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-next">Whatâ€™s Next?
</h2> 
        <p>Iâ€™m now feeling more confident with front-end basics and am excited to continue learning. My next step is diving into JavaScript to bring interactivity to my web pages. I also plan to build more personal projects and share them on GitHub.<br><br>
Eventually, my goal is to become a front-end developer and work on meaningful projects, whether remotely or as part of a creative tech team.
</p>
        
        <h2 id="final-thought">Final Thoughts
</h2> 
        <p>This journey has taught me more than just codeâ€”itâ€™s taught me resilience, problem-solving, and the power of self-belief. If youâ€™re starting your own journey into tech, know that progress is possible one step at a time.
